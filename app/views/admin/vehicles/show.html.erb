<h2>Research and Support</h2>

<p>We're always researching new and exciting vehicles to support.  Some of them we've cracked, and some of them are in progress.</p>
<p>Below is a list of models we have began supporting and/or researching.</p>

<ul>
  <% @model.vehicle_configs.where(parent_id: nil).each do |config| %>
  <li>
    <%=config.name%>
  </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
