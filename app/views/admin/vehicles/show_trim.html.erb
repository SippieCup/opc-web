Openpilot has some compatibility with the <strong><%=@model.name %></strong> and this page serves as a general overview of the model.
This page has the most specific information about a particular trim and what is required to get Openpilot working.</p>

<p>The goal is to always support as many vehicles as possible.</p>

<h2>Configurations</h2>

<p>Many trims have multiple configurations available to help support Openpilot.</p>
<p>We generally try to compare each configuration so you can see what capabilities you gain from using Openpilot and which capabilities you unfortunately sometimes lose with Openpilot.</p>
<p>These configurations are one of 4 setups: Factory, Standard, Basic and Advanced.
<% config_types = VehicleConfigType.all.order(:difficulty_level) %>
<% config_types.each do |type| %>
  <h3><%=type.name%></h3>
