    title: "What does Openpilot do?",
    markdown: " Openpilot is open-source software that runs on the EON to maintain your vehicle in your lane and slows down/speeds up for the vehicle ahead on straight and mildly curvy roads.  It records the car's CAN bus data and forward-facing video to train the driving model to perform better."
  },
  {
    title: "What does Openpilot not do?",
    markdown: " Openpilot does not drive your car from point A to point B, end-to-end.  It does not allow you to take your eyes off the road, check your phone, go to sleep, or do any of the unsafe things you may see people doing in other vehicles on YouTube.  You, the driver, are responsible for taking over control at any time."
  },
  {
    title: "How does Openpilot work?",
    markdown: " It uses the EON onboard camera to read the lane lines, center the car in-between them, and follow curves.  It uses the car's CAN bus to read data from the powertrain and radar buses, makes a decision, and writes messages back to the bus.  The car's control electronics interpret those messages to accelerate/decelerate the car, and turn the steering wheel."
  },
  {
    title: "Does Openpilot see the car in front of me?",
    markdown: " Yes, Openpilot sees the radar signature of the vehicle ahead of you and maintains a distance of approximately 1.8 seconds.  On most models, your vehicle can come to a complete stop while under Openpilot control.  On many hybrid models, the car can resume moving from a complete stop without driver intervention.  See opc.ai for more details on supported models."

  {
    title: "Does Openpilot detect traffic lights?",
    markdown: " No.  There is no traffic light detection at this time."

  {
    title: "Does Openpilot make turns at intersections?",
    markdown: " No.  Human intervention is required at this time."
  },
  {
    title: "Does Openpilot slow down for turns or at intersections?",
    markdown: " If there is a car ahead of you, it will detect it and slow down to maintain a safe distance.  Without a vehicle ahead, it will not slow down."
  },
  {
    title: "Why can't Openpilot slow down for turns?",
    markdown: " HD Maps are needed to give Openpilot a better understanding of the local environment and how to operate within it."
  },
  {
    title: "Where/When can I get HD Maps?",
    markdown: "Comma.ai is working on open-source HD Maps, targeted by the end of 2018 or early 2019.

    title: "I have a European car.  Why isn't it supported?",
    markdown: " Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Land Rover, and Volvo are some of the brands that use an optical communications method called FlexRay.  FlexRay adapters are neither cheap nor plentiful. If you can solve this problem, your model may become supported!"
  },
  {
    title: "Does Openpilot see people, animals, motorcycles, low slung trailers, plastic bags, baby strollers, or other objects on the road?",
    markdown: " It depends primarily on the ability of your car's radar to detect it.  However, many factors, including your radar's manufacturer, weather conditions, the size/height/orientation of the object, and the material the object is made out of, can change how well the radar sees the object.  Since these objects are generally not large flat pieces of metal facing you, results can vary.  Drive with care near these objects!"

    title: "Can I see how Openpilot's vision works?",
    markdown: " The vision algorithm is run under visiond, which is closed-source at this time."
  },
  {
    title: "What happens when my EON runs out of free space?",
    markdown: " Openpilot becomes disabled when EON runs out of free space (requires 15% free).  The vehicle will still function under manual control, but Openpilot cannot be re-enabled until more space is freed up. There are cron scripts that can be loaded so that the oldest drive data is removed (link)"

  },
  {
    title: "The car hugs the left or the right.  How do I correct this?",
    markdown: "Drive a bit more before worrying about mounting.  Sometimes you just simply need to hop on the nearest interstate and drive for 10 or so miles.  If you still are getting this hugging, you probably have some sort of strange offset on your mounting and need to follow one of the mounting guides below... - https://opc.ai/guides/comma-eon-mounting-calibration-7zbso7 - https://community.comma.ai/wiki/index.php/Installing_EON It's also possible that your vehicle needs some PID tuning on the steering if your vehicle hasn't been well tested."

    title: "My battery died overnight with the Panda/EON connected! How do I fix this?",
    markdown: " Your battery is probably weak, and both the Panda and EON are switched off from 12V when the car is switched off (unless you're using a comma power).  So it's more likely that you may have parasitic drain from something else in your car's electrical system such as amplifiers, radar detectors, or aftermarket head units.  [Read here](https://www.wikihow.com/Find-a-Parasitic-Battery-Drain) to learn how to check your car for parasitic drain.  If the drain current checks out at less than 50mA, have your battery tested for free at one of these major auto parts stores: Advance Auto Parts, Autozone, O'Reilly, Pep Boys."
  },
  {
    title: "On my Toyota, I'm getting a "Cruise Fault: Restart the car" message.",
    markdown: " This occurs after the EON is rebooted, or if the car is turned on without the EON connected at first.  The timing of the bus activating is faster than the Panda and Openpilot can send the appropriate CAN messages and they get out of sync.  To fix this, turn the car off for about 20 seconds and then turn the car on again.  The engine does not need to be started; simply turning the car to ACC then ON is sufficient.  For a more permanent solution, the [comma power accessory](https://comma.ai/shop/products/power/) can be installed."

  },
  {
    title: "I'm getting odd error messages, intermittent connectivity issues, or sporadic behaviors.  How do I fix this?",
    markdown: "If this is your first attempt at running Openpilot with your hardware connected, it's most likely a connection issue.  First, ensure that the your panda is completely seated all the way on the giraffe using a rocking motion.  The panda's OBD port should slide all the way onto the giraffe and bottom out completely so that the plastic housings touch.  Don't worry, they're durable and can take the stress!  Next ensure that your giraffe is properly installed and that your DIP switches are set properly.  Unplug the giraffe and flip the switches back and forth to confirm they're fully actuated and not stuck halfway.  Then plug the giraffe back in. Finally, try rebooting the EON to see if it fixes your issue."

  {
    title: "What is an EON?",
    markdown: " The EON is a OnePlus 3T cell phone, cooled with a heatsink, a phone charging and fan circuit control board, and a 3D-printed case to contain it all.  It's built and tested so that you don't have to build up the hardware yourself.  It's also been designed for a wide range of operating environments for reliability."
  },
  {
    title: "Can I build my own EON?",
    markdown: " Yes, but keep in mind that you will need to build and integrate all the hardware yourself.  Your build may overheat unpredictably while driving so safe testing is critical.

  },
  {
    title: "What's the best charging strategy when using EON?",
    markdown: "The EON generates a lot of heat from charging alone in addition to the duties of chffr or Openpilot.  Especially in hot climates or sunny days, it's best to use the following guidelines: 1. Always remove the EON from direct sunlight when not in use!  In hot climates temperatures can reach upwards of 140F (60C) which can damage the EON battery.  Some users have had their batteries puff up and pop off the screen.  To prevent this and maximize EON life, charge the EON overnight and upload data in an air-conditioned environment. 2. If fully charged, EON can be unplugged and turned off (this may cause post-boot cruise faults on Toyota models) 3. Install EON in car and drive, which causes the only heat to be generated to be the heat from the EON itself and less from charging heat."
  },
  {
    title: "Why isn't the EON heatsink enclosed for better convection?",
    markdown: " The EON is cooled primarily through convection and radiation.  The current design was analyzed for a compromise between the two.  Some users have tried various modifications such as applying foil to the windshield, adding or replacing fans, changing heatsinks, or 3D printing new cases to varying degrees of success.  If you find a better solution that works in all conditions, feel free to share with the Slack channel!"
  },
  {
    title: "What are appropriate EON temps?",
    markdown: " During rest times (uploading and charging) indoors, 35C to 40C is typical. The fan will run indoors when plugged in.  In the car with 70-75F cabin temperatures, most users have reported 45C temperatures.  50-55C is the upper limit that the EON should be run at for extended periods of time.  63C is the current shutoff temperature for Openpilot, in which it will no longer function until cooled down.  Try stopping in a safe location and rebooting EON to see if it resets the charging circuit."
  },
  {
    title: "What's a cheap way to cool the EON better while driving?",
    markdown: " Try the front window defroster or a device called a Noggle.  RAV4 users have made a vent deflector for the front top vent.  Make sure the onboard fan is running.  If not running, try stopping in a safe location and reboot EON to see if it resets the charging circuit."
  },
  {
    title: "Why does my EON charge intermittently?",
    markdown: "The charging circuit limits charging when temperatures go over a certain level.  This usually happens when the battery is very low and the ambient temperatures are high.  Try: 1. Disabling driver monitoring if enabled.   2. Removing SIM card to prevent cell transmissions. 3. Rebooting EON.  4. Using different USB cables.  They can also be a culprit if damaged or worn.  Other causes are under investigation."
